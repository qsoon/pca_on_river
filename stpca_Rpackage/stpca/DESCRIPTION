Description: This package consists of functions that can be used to investigate
    re-designing monitoring networks, with particular emphasis on river networks.
    For spatiotemporal data this package will allow users to identify areas of
    the river network where observatations have remained stable over time, and
    also identify groups of monitoring sites with similar behaviour over time.
    Weights can be incorporated to adjust for spatial and temporal correlation.
    For spatial data, this package will allow users to investigate how reducing
    the size of the monitoring network affects predictions at unobserved locations,
    and also how the choice of sampling scheme affects predictions.  Many of the
    functions in this package are wrappers for functions from other packages and
    these are referenced throughout the help files.
